- 👋 Hi, I’m @ADDiMarco, but you can call me Anthony.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code using C# and create 3D and 2D realtime environments using Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on either a game or an AI/machine learning agent.
- 📫 You can reach me here on GitHub or by email.
